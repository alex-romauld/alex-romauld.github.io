              <h4>Stepping On Sandcastles</h4>

			  <p>Stepping On Sand Castles had undergone many revisions. This was a long term solo project that explored ideas about game narratives. The game was built in Unity. All of the models and animation were done by hand in 3ds-max.</p>
			  <img src="res/BoxNinja_Dev.png">

			  <p>It started out as a first-person puzzle platformer in which you launched boxes to move around and solve puzzles. There were surfaces that increased run and jump speed, anti-gravity zones, buttons, bridges, fans, and more.</p>

			  <p>As the game took shape, I became fixated on the development of  the story. Initially the story was meant to merely be glue piecing the rest of the game together. I soon found that the story parts quickly surpassed the rest of the game in terms of interestingness. It was clear that the story was being held back by being forced into the existing game mold I had.</p>

			  <p>I myself, am not a fan of when games do this. When a story runs parallel to the game, and in many cases the game contradicts with the tone and events in the story. I decided to drop the platforming entirely and focus on building a game that supports the story.</p>


			  <img src="res/BoxNinja_Construction.png">
			  <p>The direction this took involved building out various challenges into the world that had symbolic meaning within the story. These included memory games, patience tests, detective reasoning, and a stage performance.</p>

			  <p>Games are an inherently interactive medium, which runs contradictory to traditional storytelling. Crafting a deep narrative game experience requires new ways of approaching narrative that I feel the medium of games has yet to fully investigate, let alone master. Armed with this new perspective I’ve since stumbled upon a methodology for narrative that I prefer, one that’s about discoverability and allowing the player to understand or not understand the world they’re in. This was the approach with the following game West-Ward.</p>

			  <p>For those wanting more detail, here’s a complete overview of the project:</p>
