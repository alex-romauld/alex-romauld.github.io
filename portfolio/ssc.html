              <h4>Stepping On Sandcastles</h4>
			  <p>Stepping on Sand Castles had undergone many revisions. It started out as a first-person puzzle platformer in which you launched boxes to move around and solve puzzles.</p>


			  <img src="res/BoxNinja_Construction.png">
			  <p>Taking a good long look at what I had, I realized the parts of the game I was most excited about was specifically the story that developed around the game. In an attempt to avoid making a game that mashes together two things that have nothing to do with each other. I decided to drop the platforming entirely and focus on building an interesting game out of the story.</p>

			  <img src="res/BoxNinja_Dev.png">
			  <p>This was a long term solo project that explored game ideas and Unity. The game was built in Unity. All of the models and animation were done by hand in 3ds-max.</p>

			  <img src="res/BoxNinja_Hand.png">
			  <p>I eventually found that what I was building was the kind of thing I didn’t like in other games. A game of random, arbitrary tasks in service of telling a story that had nothing to do with what the player was actually doing at any given moment. Stories in games do not work like other mediums. Games are inherently interactive, and good stories are not. This project gave me a new perspective on stories in games that I carry with me into all my future projects.</p>

			  <p>For those wanting more detail, here’s a complete overview of the project:</p>
